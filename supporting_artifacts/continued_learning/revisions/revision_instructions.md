## NOTE: YOUR COMMENTS ARE INCLUDED ON HTML IN FILE

I decided to include these revisions as you directly mentioned that they were good, in addition to the time I spent on them. I like this revisions as I took the time to really consider why you gave them to me, rather than just fixing them and stating that. I know that you give each revision for a reason, and that they can relate to certain overarching topics in the class. Because of this, I made sure to really take my time to answer each revision properly, consisting of how I fixed each problem and why you gave me the revision.

Revisions for Lab 4:

Revisions: Identifying Important Regions: At first I was confused by your remark, but then I took a closer look at the dataset and realized I forgot some important regions. Specifically, I forgot to include the GreatLakes region. For future reference I need to do a better job at looking the dataset before starting the lab.

Exercise 1:

Because we were learning about dataframes this wee, I was under the assumption you wanted us to join a mutated join for this step. However, a single filter function makes a lot more sense in this situation.

Exercise 3:

In order to keep the maximum amount of efficiency within the quarto document, I should utilize the dataframe I created before. Rather than filter and type the names out again, it is more efficient to filter join the two dataframes together by region. Creating Reshaping Data: Earlier in the lab it made sense to use a simple filter as we were just filtering one instance of the region variable. However when there are multiple CA Cities that we are going to be filtering for in the dataset it is better to create a dataframe and then use a filter join.

Reshaping Data Plot:

As mentioned in my last revisions, I need to be under the impression that I am presenting this quarto document to someone who has no prior understanding of the dataset. Because of this "Difference In Averages" does not actually tell anyone anything about what the plot is showing. Instead I relabeled the plot accordingly to be more descriptive. Lastly, I pivoted the dataset should I could subtract the organic vs conventional rather than using the lag() function.

Revisions for lab 3:

Revisions: Summary of Dataset: I needed to include more information regarding the study, as I forgot that I should be under the impression that my quarto document is the first glimpse someone should have of the dataset. Because of this, I needed to include more info regarding the dataset I am working with.

Unique Words: I have struggled so far condensing my output code, as for the most part it is pretty messy. Going forward I understand that I should strive to make my outputs as concise as possible, so my quarto documents are neat. Investigation of demographics: Without any code output, there is no way to verify the claims I have made without manually running the code. Including code output would remove the hassle from the viewer of my quarto document.

Plots: I did not realize that ggplot2 was within tidyverse, although I am sure you mentioned that in class. I now understand why I do not need to load ggplot2 in, as it is already loaded in when I load tidyverse. Additionally, I did not want to use a boxplot for the second plot as I already used a boxplot for plot 1 and I wanted to reinforce my capability of using multiple plots.

Familiar Words: Prior to the last class, I was very confused on the syntax of the summarize() function, which is why I believe I calculated the average by hand. After these past couple of lectures, I am far more comfortable utilizing the summarize function. When you have the capability to shorten your code you definitely should, as it may not make a huge difference in small quarto documents but it makes a large difference in larger documents as the unoptimal code adds up.\
