## Exercise 1

```{r}
thanksgiving = ymd("20181122")
pm_suspect_times = suspect_times |> 
  mutate(Time.Spotted = force_tz(Time.Spotted, tzone = "America/Los_Angeles")) |> 
  filter(pm(Time.Spotted) == TRUE,
         wday(Time.Spotted, label = TRUE) != c("Tue","Thu"),
         day(thanksgiving - 35) <= day(Time.Spotted),
         day(Time.Spotted) <= day(thanksgiving + 35),
         pm(force_tz(Time.Spotted, tzone = "GMT")) == TRUE,
         mday(Time.Spotted) == 23 | mday(Time.Spotted) == 22,
         (difftime(ymd("19700101"), Time.Spotted, tz,
         units = "mins") %% 10 == 0))
